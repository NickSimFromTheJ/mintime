A Simple pipeline state exploitation written in c++ with the following features
        + Timing based arithmitic
        + Greedy Algorithm to find the most amount of incremental cycles
        + Finds better operation based on CPU

WARNING: Needs more testing on other CPUs
WARNING: Needs docs and doxygen.
